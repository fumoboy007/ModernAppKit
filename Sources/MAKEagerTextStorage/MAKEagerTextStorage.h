/// A concrete `NSTextStorage` subclass that tells its `MAKEagerLayoutManaging` objects to
/// perform layout after every edit.
///
/// - Remark: At first glance, we might be able to use
///           `-[NSLayoutManager processEditingForTextStorage:edited:range:changeInLength:invalidatedRange:]`,
///           which is called automatically by `NSTextStorage` at the end of editing. That would
///           eliminate the need for this subclass. However, attempting to perform layout from
///           within that method causes an exception to be thrown because `NSTextStorage`
///           has not actually ended the edit yet.
///
/// - Note: This is implemented in Objective-C to avoid bridging costs to/from Swift (SR-6197).
///         This improves text layout performance dramatically compared to the Swift implementation.
